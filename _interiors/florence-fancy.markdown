The owners of Florence Fancy aimed to create a one-of-a-kind boutique shopping experience with the feel of a private club. The company offers the finest childrens’ clothing made exclusively in Europe. Set atop a privately owned townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side and accessible by appointment only, the chic lounge-like environment truly makes visiting this boutique a special event. Nicole Fuller Interiors was responsible for every element of the company’s branding and the boutique’s design and build-out. Navy, white, and pale lavender combine to create a gender neutral and luxurious color palette. Upon entry, each guest is served tea and Ladurée macarons atop vintage Hermès tea sets. Fuller designed every inch of the interior, from the grand window treatments and custom carpeting to a set of bespoke cast-plaster animal heads which are now part of Fuller’s own Isabella Wolfe *Fantasy* collection.
