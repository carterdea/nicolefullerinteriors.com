Nicole Fuller Interiors collaborated with NYC architect Alma Hadrovic to turn this previously stark one-bedroom loft into the show-stopping penthouse apartment it was meant to be. The owners are a young and effortlessly cool couple who love to entertain, and Fuller gave them a floor plan and finishes that fit their social and colorful lifestyle. 15’ high ceilings left room for grand moldings and classical trim, while the furnishings and hardware offer more modern appeal. Custom finishes are found throughout, from the black-lacquered living room bookcase and its Arabescato marble fireplace surround to statement roman shades and playful tin ceiling tiles in the study. Covering the master bath, precious green marble imported from Italy was bookmatched into a unique and modern chevron pattern. To house the couples’ impressive wine collection, Fuller collaborated with Joseph Carter Wine Walls to create a statement design feature, setting the tone that this home is meant for the gathering of friends.
