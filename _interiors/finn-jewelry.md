The Finn Jewelry showroom was envisioned by Nicole Fuller Interiors out of a dark, empty industrial loft on Great Jones Street in the trendy downtown NoHo neighborhood. As a brand, Finn embodies youthful luxury by fashioning whimsical designs out of serious precious materials. Fuller designed a mixed use space that fits this aesthetic by combining French-inspired finishes with modern elements against the structural backdrop of a cool New York loft. The result is a hip and luxurious shopping environment suitable for their celebrity clientele.
