This 2-bedroom residence located on 5th Avenue, boasting extraordinary views, is owned by a young couple who wanted to keep the space fresh. We achieved this with a neutral color pallet with splashes of color. The home was furnished with pieces from Espasso such as Sergio Rodrigues dining chairs and also Ralph Pucci and complimented with artwork by Retna, and Elliott Puckette and M.F. Husain. Functionality was a priority; so, we converted a storage closet into a studio office complete with custom mill work: built in storage, shelving and wall paneling all in oxblood high gloss lacquer. The sliding doors to the office and guest room were tailor made with specialty treatment finishes to give them an architectural design feature. The space was then completed with a bespoke bar for their entertainment needs.
