In designing Gianvito Rossi's New York City showroom, Nicole Fuller Interiors drew inspiration from the lauded footwear designer's signature aesthetic: modern and sensual femininity. When one enters the space, which is located on the second floor of an Upper East Side townhouse in Manhattan, they are enveloped by floor-to-ceiling wall treatments in a nude blush. Display shelves dressed in brushed brass serpentine throughout the space with furnishings upholstered in iridescent off-white velvets, reminiscent of pearls found in a clamshell. To add a bit of mood, the window treatments are minimalist sheers in warm, smokey grey, tied back with brushed-brass brackets. The soft fabrics and sophisticated metallics are pulled together with Calacatta gold marble with its matte finish and warm veining. Fuller integrated built-in cabinetry with brass hardware throughout the lower perimeter of the space allowing much-needed showroom storage without compromising the square footage of showroom. The result is a retail showroom space that is a true reflection of the brand it represents. Featuring the finest finishes and expert craftsmanship with a look that is modern and feminine, Nicole Fuller created a showroom space that acts as a versatile backdrop for the true stars: the shoes.
