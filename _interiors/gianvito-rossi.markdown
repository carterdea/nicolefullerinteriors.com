In designing Gianvito Rossi's New York City showroom, Nicole Fuller Interiors drew inspiration from the lauded footwear designer's signature aesthetic of modern and sensual femininity. When one enters the space, which is located in Manhattan on the second floor of an Upper East Side townhouse, they are enveloped by floor-to-ceiling wall treatments in nude blush. Display shelves dressed in brushed brass serpentine throughout the space. Furnishings are upholstered in taupe leather and iridescent off-white velvets, reminiscent of pearls found in a clamshell. To add a bit of mood, the window treatments are minimalist, smokey grey sheers, tied back with brackets in brushed brass. The soft fabrics and sophisticated metallics are pulled together with Calacatta Gold marble with its matte finish and prized warm veining. Fuller integrated built-in cabinetry with brass hardware throughout the lower perimeter of the space, allowing much-needed showroom storage without compromising square footage. The result is a retail space that is a true reflection of the brand it represents. Featuring the finest finishes executed with expert craftsmanship and a look that is modern and feminine, Nicole Fuller created a showroom that acts as a versatile backdrop for the *true* stars: the shoes.
