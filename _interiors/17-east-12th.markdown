Situated along Manhattan’s prestigious “Gold Coast,” the building at 17 East 12th Street was developed by Rigby Asset Management, a New York-based real estate investment and development firm that specializes in rehabilitating underutilized commercial properties into high-end residential buildings. For the building’s model apartment, Rigby enlisted Nicole Fuller Interiors to create a bold and luxurious environment that complemented the grand vision of project architect, Bromley Caldari. Fuller specified products from her not-so-little black book of design resources to stage the space with museum-quality artworks, precious antiques, statement light fixtures, and contemporary furnishings, rugs, and window treatments.
