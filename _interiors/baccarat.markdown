The redesign of this full floor Midtown Manhattan home located in the Baccarat Hotel and Residences, was brought to life by Nicole Fuller Interiors. This magnificent pied-a-terre has sweeping views of the city and features artwork by Andy Warhol. Fuller treated the walls with a myriad of Italian plaster finishes along with high gloss lacquered wall panels, and divided the main living area into three separate vignettes, all while keeping with the client's European chic tastes. Nicole Fuller Interior's redesigned the Master Suite, adding a luxurious, walk in closet adorned in a lacquered linen finish, in the color of Hermes Greige and Baccarat fixtures. Fuller's touches of color, layered with soft neutral tones and textures throughout, lends itself perfectly to this balanced and sophisticated interior.
