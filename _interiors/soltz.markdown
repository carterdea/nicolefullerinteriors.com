This bold and daring client gave Nicole Fuller Interiors carte blanche to create his colorful and fully custom luxury home. Coordinating between builder and an architect, Fuller completely gutted the space, reconfigured the layout, and specified each and every finish. Decorated with museum-quality vintage finds, auction items from Philips de Pury, gallery-quality furnishings from Ralph Pucci, lighting by Lindsey Adelman, and important contemporary art, every square inch of this apartment is noteworthy. Fuller also created various bespoke elements such as custom wall treatments for each room, and a master bathroom tiled in precious white gold mosaic from Bisazza.
