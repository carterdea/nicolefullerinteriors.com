This custom built modern Hamptons home was realized from the ground up by Nicole Fuller Interiors. Working together with the architect and builder, Fuller imbued the home with a sense of bohemian sophistication. The look is achieved through Fuller's signature use of black structural elements, such as dark windows to ground the space, alongside a light, neutral palette that echoes the surrounding seagrass and dunes. The home is furnished with an eclectic mix of vintage designs, custom furnishings, and transitional elements.  In the living room, the ethnic vibe of texture-heavy Moroccan designs set against a precious silver travertine fireplace creates a look of effortless luxury.
