This Pied a Terre, located in the West Village, received a top to bottom makeover care of Nicole Fuller Interiors. Crown molding was added throughout and a vintage mirror was draped in the living room to create depth and original character in this prewar building. Colorful elements were used throughout the light filled space to play off of the artwork. The furnishings are classic and refined to be in harmony with the architectural elements such as the ceiling beams. A soothing monochromatic palette was chosen for the bedroom to create a sophisticated retreat for our clients to unwind.
