In designing the Gleit residence, Nicole Fuller sought to create a sexy bachelor pad in the sky. The interiors are largely inspired by the client's love for travel and his eclectic collection of art and objects collected over the years, such as vintage Venetian carnival masks that Fuller set in sophisticated lucite boxes. Fuller created a custom wall finish for the apartment, painted by hand onto Japanese rice paper. Fuller's team also designed a custom built Patina bronze fireplace to add warmth to the space. Many of the furnishes are curated vintage pieces from 1stdibs.com and other auction sources.
