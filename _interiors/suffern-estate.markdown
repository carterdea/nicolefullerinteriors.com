The owners of this upstate New York home are a young and upbeat family who were seeking a country retreat that exuded their modern, eclectic style. The 28,000 square foot, new-construction house was was designed by Nicole Fuller Interiors and Brandes Maselli Architects to appear as a historic house with a modern floor plan and state-of-the-art amenities. For the interiors, the goal was to create a series of unique and contemporary interiors that would layer beautifully with the traditional architecture of the home. Nicole Fuller created room after room of grand, eye-popping spaces that, as a whole, still function as a cozy and intimate family home.
