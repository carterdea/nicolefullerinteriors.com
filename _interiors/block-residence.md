When a British couple purchased this New York pied-à-terre, they turned to Nicole Fuller Interiors to design a space that exuded their love for art deco style and bespoke finishes. The wife, a photographer, also loved the color purple in all its varieties. Fuller found ways to play up her signature hue throughout the space, grounding it with soft metallics and natural materials. With sweeping views of New York’s art deco masterpiece, the Chrysler Building, the Block residence is a tasteful nod to the 1920s movement with 21st century sensibility. Bespoke finishes are found throughout, from custom window treatments and built-ins to hand-applied wall coverings such as the starburst marquetry pattern in the front foyer developed in collaboration with the late Maya Romanoff.
