## About Nicole Fuller

Nicole Fuller, founder and principal of Nicole Fuller Interiors, is an award-winning luxury designer specializing in sophisticated, highly customized residential and commercial projects in the US and abroad. Based in New York with offices in Los Angeles, Nicole has cultivated a reputation for excellence with her domestic design projects including the Arch District Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles and the Baccarat Residences, as well as international partnerships with Dempsey & Carroll, Ann Sacks, Fromental, Savoir Beds, and The Rug Company, to name a few. An established art consultant with exclusive access to the world’s leading galleries and sought-after artists, Fuller’s talents extend to curating pieces meant to transform or elevate any space. Her work has earned four International Property awards, two nominations for London’s prestigious Andrew Martin Designer of the Year award, and was listed by Vogue Magazine as an Interior Design Talent to Watch.

With a design modality that adheres not to one specific aesthetic but rather embodies a commitment to sophisticated taste and timeless style, Nicole has acquired a list of prestigious clients such as Gianvito Rossi, Zac Posen, and Usher. No challenge is too great; whether it is hand-painting wall treatments, creating custom furnishings or sourcing vintage accents, by layering classic elements with modern pieces, the spaces Nicole creates are luxurious and refined representations of her unparalleled commitment to visually dazzling and polished design.
